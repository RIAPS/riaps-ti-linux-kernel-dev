+STMPE ADC driver
+----------------
+
+Required properties:
+ - compatible: "st,stmpe-adc"
+
+Optional properties:
+Note that the ADC is shared with the STMPE touchscreen. ADC related settings
+have to be done in the mfd.
+- st,norequest-mask: bitmask specifying which ADC channels should _not_ be
+  requestable due to different usage (e.g. touch)
+
+Node name must be stmpe_adc and should be child node of stmpe node to
+which it belongs.
+
+Example:
+
+	stmpe_adc {
+		compatible = "st,stmpe-adc";
+		st,norequest-mask = <0x0F>; /* dont use ADC CH3-0 */
+	};
