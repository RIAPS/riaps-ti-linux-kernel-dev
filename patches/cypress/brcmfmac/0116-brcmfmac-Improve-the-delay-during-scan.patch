Subject: [PATCH 116/117] brcmfmac: Improve the delay during scan

wpa_supplicant sends NL80211_CMD_GET_SURVEY command every after normal
scan, which causes brcmfmac surveying each channel again.

Currently brcmfmac implments brcmf_cfg80211_dump_survey focusing on AP
mode, thus this change will return the request other than AP mode.
