Subject: [PATCH 081/111] brcmfmac: validate ifp pointer in brcmf_txfinalize

We got ifp null pointer kernel panic in brcmf_txfinalize after removing
Wi-Fi USB dongle when data was transmitting, The root cause is that
interface was removed before calling brcmf_txfinalize in
brcmf_fws_dequeue_worker and finally caused kernel panic.
